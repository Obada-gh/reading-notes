# EJS Partials:
Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.
## Basic setup

First, install EJS:

Using the package manager [`npm`](https://npmjs.com):
```sh
npm install ejs
```

Or using the package manager [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com):
```sh
yarn add ejs
```

In Express v4, a very basic setup using EJS would look like the following. (This assumes a `views` directory containing an `index.ejs` page.

```javascript
let express = require('express');
let app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', {foo: 'FOO'});
});

app.listen(4000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 4000!'));
```

There are a number of ways to pass specific configuration values to EJS from Express.

## View options

This is the most straightforward method, although `view options` has not been a documented option to use with Express since version 2. Use `app.set` to set `view options`:

```javascript
app.set('view options', {delimiter: '?'});
```
This method works for all options, even those which cannot be safely passed along with data, like `root`. It also allows you to set EJS options once, in one place.

## Custom render function

This is somewhat less straightforward, but also works well -- completely overrides the render function:

```javascript
let ejsOptions = {delimiter: '?'};
app.engine('ejs', (path, data, cb) => {
  ejs.renderFile(path, data, ejsOptions, cb);
});
```
This method works for all options, even those which cannot be safely passed along with data, like `root`. It also allows you to set EJS options once, in one place.

## App locals

Any properties set on `app.locals` will get mixed in to the `data` object passed into a render call for the view engine, and those with names matching known opts properties will be passed to EJS as opts:

```javascript
app.locals.delimiter = '?'
```
This does allow you to set your EJS options in one place, but will not work for unsafe options like `root`.

## Passing opts with data

Any properties in the data object for a `render` call with names matching known opts properties will be passed to EJS as opts:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', {foo: 'FOO', delimiter: '?'});
});
```
This approach means you have to pass EJS options in every single render call, and also does not work with unsafe options like `root`.

## example Partials:
```
<!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->
    <div class="header clearfix">
        <nav>
            <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
                <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>
        </nav>
    </div>
```
```
<!-- views/post.ejs -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>POST_TITLE | Node.js Blog</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <style>
            body {
                padding-top: 20px;
                padding-bottom: 20px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <%- include('partials/navbar') %>
            <div>
                <h2>POST_TITLE</h2>
                <p>by <a href="#">POST_AUTHOR</a></p>
                <p>POST_CONTENT</p>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <%- include('partials/footer') %>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
