
## Pain vs. Suffering:

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

Suffering is dependent on the story that we layer on top of our pain.

push yourself to work hard.

## Big O:

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann,[1] Edmund Landau,[2] and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.

## Names and Values in Python:

Just as names have no type, values have no scope. When we say that a function has a local variable, we mean that the name is scoped to the function: you can’t use the name outside the function, and when the function returns, the name is destroyed. But as we’ve seen, if the name’s value has other references, it will live on beyond the function call. It is a local name, not a local value.

Values can be created, used, and ultimately destroyed all up and down the call stack. There is no rule about when values can be created, and how long they can live.
