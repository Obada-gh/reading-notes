# Code 301 Reading Notes

hallo there i will sumorize for you some concepts that i learned today.
>in the end there is a quiz for you and a map for our info. &#128175;

## How the Web Works (visualization)

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure : its the page how its looks these are main pionts you need to understand

* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Pain vs. Suffering:

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

Suffering is dependent on the story that we layer on top of our pain.

push yourself to work hard.

## Big O:

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann,[1] Edmund Landau,[2] and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.

## Names and Values in Python:

Just as names have no type, values have no scope. When we say that a function has a local variable, we mean that the name is scoped to the function: you can’t use the name outside the function, and when the function returns, the name is destroyed. But as we’ve seen, if the name’s value has other references, it will live on beyond the function call. It is a local name, not a local value.

Values can be created, used, and ultimately destroyed all up and down the call stack. There is no rule about when values can be created, and how long they can live.

## Cheats sheet

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.you just need to make a file with .md extension on Vs code and good to go with this cheats sheet:

 HEADERS :

```

    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ##### This is an <h6> tag

```

list :

```
     orderd:
         1. Item 1
         2. Item 2
         3. Item 3
     unorder:    

         * Item 3a
         * Item 3b

 ```  

EMPHASIS :

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```

BLOCKQUOTES :

```
> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.
```

> I’ve always been more interested
> in the future than in the past.

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message

* Keep in mind: This has all been said before.
* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
