## The Random module:

Random functions
The Random module contains some very useful functions
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```
you can see just we use import the random to get the modle
the output 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

another examples:
```
import random
random.random() * 100
```
```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```

## What is Risk Analysis:

Along the way on your programming journey, there are a few milestones that you need to conquer to advance ahead. For example, getting comfortable with classes, understanding pointers, master the art of functionalizing your code, and so on. One of the trickest programming concepts to learn for newcomers and master for those who have been programming for a while is Risk Analysis.

Risk Analysis:risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications

Steps to train your mind to think about the risk:
1. Use of new hardware.
2. Use of new technology.
3. Use of new automation tool.
4. The sequence of code.
5. Availability of test resources for the application.

Risk Identification:

1. Business Risks
2. Testing Risks
3. Premature Release Risk
4. Software Risks

How to perform Risk Analysis?:
1. Searching the risk
2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
3. Measures for the risk identified
