## Recursion:

In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Such problems can generally be solved by iteration, but this needs to identify and index the smaller instances at programming time.

## Python Exceptions:

In Python, exceptions can be handled using a try statement. The critical operation which can raise an exception is placed inside the try clause. The code that handles the exceptions is written in the except clause. ... If no exception occurs, the except block is skipped and normal flow continues(for last value).

Until now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.

Syntax Errors:
Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:
```
>>> while True print('Hello world')
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    while True print('Hello world')
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
Exceptions:

```
>>> 10 * (1/0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>> 4 + spam*3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'spam' is not defined
>>> '2' + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
```

## Reading and Writing Files in Python:

When you’re working with Python, you don’t need to import a library in order to read and write to files. It’s handled natively in the language, albeit in a unique manner.

The first thing you’ll need to do is use the built-in python open file function to get a file object.
