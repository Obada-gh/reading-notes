## How the Web Works (visualization):
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure : its the page how its looks these are main pionts you need to understand :

* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.



## Grid Garden:
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
to Grid Garden, where you write CSS code to grow your carrot garden! Water only the areas that have carrots by using the grid-column-start property.
For example, grid-column-start: 3; will water the area starting at the 3rd vertical grid line, which is another way of saying the 3rd vertical border from the left in the grid. for more (w3schools)[https://www.w3schools.com/]
