## When Women Stopped Coding:

1984: The Year Women Left Coding

## Why diversity matters to your tech company ?
So, if diversity is so important, why are we missing the mark? If you look at the top companies in Silicon Valley, it is overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly white. In the US, women make up just 17 percent of the total tech workforce, while LatinX and Black software developers make up 6% and 3% respectively of employees in the top 75 Silicon Valley tech companies.

## Cheats sheet

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.you just need to make a file with .md extension on Vs code and good to go with this cheats sheet:

 HEADERS :

```

    # This is an <h1> tag
    ## This is an <h2> tag
    ##### This is an <h6> tag

```

list :

```
     orderd:
         1. Item 1
         2. Item 2
         3. Item 3
     unorder:    

         * Item 3a
         * Item 3b

 ```  

EMPHASIS :

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
*You **can** combine them*
```
